Subhalo Merger Tree Extension Algorithm
---------------------------------------

This repository hosts the source code used in the work *"A Conditional Abundance Matching Method of Extending Simulated Halo Merger Trees to Resolve Low-Mass Progenitors and Sub-halos"* ([arXiv: 2301.08972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08972)) authored by Yangyao Chen et al.

The organization of the code and the documentation of this project is under progress. Update will be pushed here gradually.

For any reader interested in this project, an un-documented version of the code was prepared. Please contact Yangyao Chen ([yangyaochen.astro@foxmail.com](mailto:yangyaochen.astro@foxmail.com)) to obtain it.
